Animate the logo with keyframes.  (Here is a keyframes reference.) It should start at a width of 25px and grow to 475px.  It should also start with an opacity of 0 and end with an opacity of 1.

You need to think about this from a “flex” perspective and realize that flex-direction will affect the size of the elements.  You can see that in the mobile view they all have the same width.
